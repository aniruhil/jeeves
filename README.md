# jeeves

This is a package I built, following [Erik Howard's `hgwellsr` package](https://github.com/erikhoward/hgwellsr) and ["how to" blog post](https://www.erikhoward.net/create-r-data-package/), with all **P.G. Wodehouse** authored texts I could find on [Project Guttenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

If you are not a Wodehouse fan, well, then this may not be  for you. But, it is never too late to join the club!

You can install the package with `devtools` via 

```{r}
devtools::install_github("aniruhil/jeeves")
```

and load it as usual 

```{r}
library(jeeves)
```

Please file an issue if you see any hiccups.
