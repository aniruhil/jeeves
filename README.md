# jeeves

This is a package I built, following Erik Howard's `hgwellsr` package and "how to" blog post, with all **P.G. Wodehouse** authored texts I could find on [Project Guttenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

If you are not a Wodehouse fan, well, then this may not be  for you. But, it is never too late to join the club!

You can install the package with 

```{r}
devtools::install_github("aniruhil/jeeves")
```

and load it via 

```{r}
library(jeeves)
```
